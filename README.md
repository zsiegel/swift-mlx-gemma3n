# swift-mlx-gemma3n

A swift-mlx port of Gemma3n. This was hacked together over a few days of work and is currently a WIP. The model could certainly be optimized further. I used Claude and o3 to help me through some tricky bits where MLX differs with Swift or is behind the Python lib.

- Language model is supported 2B and 4B
- Video/Audio support to follow hopefully soon!
